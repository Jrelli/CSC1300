    Title: lab2a.cpp
    Author: N/A, debugged by Joey and Shane

    Purpose:    The program should ask the user for their name, display a welcome message (with 
                their name), and then print you & your partnerâ€™s names and a fun fact about each of you.   
                Then the program should ask the user for the radius of a circle, then calculate and print the area.
